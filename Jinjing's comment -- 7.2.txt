1. "So, currently the program yields and ask to build another hotel after a set amount of time. This is done in World.py:
            yield self.env.timeout(10)"

This is not quite right. Don't want the program to stay and wait for 10 units of time. I want it to run for 10 units of time, and then stop. So this does not work.

Instead, I created a new process in Menu.py called WeellyReport(). Once I yeild it in other process, the other process can be resumed once the process is finished.(See http://simpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/simpy_intro/process_interaction.html )

Also, I used G.maxTime to present a week


2.Added a check before every yeild report to make sure the weeklyreport doesn't happen during the yield

3.My WeeklyReport(in Menu.py) just print out things, need to add in functionality for people to make further investment.

4. In my world, I only run for 20 days, so only has 2 weeks


2. Need to do input check for all inputs: add in functions in Tools.py
