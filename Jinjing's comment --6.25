1. added checking valid input to HotelController:
	a. using a try-except block 
	b. method called checkValidInput()


2. Changed BuyHotel to HotelController

3. The problem I'm having is in I was wishing BuyHotel() to return a True or False. But it didn't. It just returns None , and so my condition check in HotelCotnroller "if self.BuyHotel(hotel,player):" doesn't work at all. Don't know why
