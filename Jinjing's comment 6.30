1. moved vistit() method to Customer. 
2. add in a resource request():
	"""with resource.request() as req:
            yield req """
        it request a resource and waits until it's avaiable. 
        and it release the resouce after using it.(for reference, see: http://simpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/simpy_intro/shared_resources.html)
3. Make all simulation classes into subclasses of Process(not sure what's the benefit of doingthis,just following the example)

4. Created an Arrival class (use the way in the pdf I sent you ) that generates Customer semi-randomly. Can run the Arrival module in python to see how it works.I think it kinda work as I want, although not perfectly,should be easy to adjust a bit.

5. the next task is to adapt this Customer for BankController model into our Hotel model. To create resouces within hotel, i.e hotel rooms. and let customers use the resources.( Maybe should also add in a type identifer for the Arrival class, to represent distinct objects for different simulation of arrival flow in different Hotels. )
