Jinjing's Comment 7-13 :
1. Use urllib package 
2. file = "downloaded_file.html"

	

	#open the file for writing
	fh = open(file, "w")

	# read from request while writing to file
	fh.write('1,2345sjdhfgkhask')
	fh.close()

	write to file

	or # You can also use the with statement:
"with open(file, 'w') as f: f.write(response.read())"
