"So for each time interval, it'd call Hotle.run() and Land.run(), which would run the processes for these 2 controllers".

 Can use the yeild command in Simpy 



" class Hotel_Controller:
	arrHotels = []
	def Run()
		self.Purchase()
		self.Update()


	def Update
		for hotel in arrHotels
			hotel.Run()  " 


still don't think run method is really necessary. 


"So, what it would do first is setup the environment: Create a player, create the other controllers, and start the time keeping (simulation of time)
Now, within it, it'd call the other controllers. 
"
can't start the time keeping until you really have set up your first hotel(that's what I was doing in my GameFunction Module) (sorry, this is more detailed than the architecture scale)
