So, currently the program yields and ask to build another hotel after a set amount of time. This is done in World.py:
            yield self.env.timeout(10)
            hc.build_new_hotel(player)
So, after '10' units of time, it asks the player to build another hotel.
This will need some tweaking as I'm not sure long a week is

Other Needed Changes:
Need to modify so that hotels are choosens randomly and that the rooms are choosen randomly but if full they move in the order that we talked about
