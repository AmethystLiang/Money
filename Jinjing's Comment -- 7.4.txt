1. Fixing the issue that once the customer doesn't have money to buy something, the program just stopped.
2. Modified the get_option(m,options) method in Tools.py
3. Created a function produce_hotel_option 
4. Commented out the print arriving customer thing in Customer.py , for testing purpose
5.check_positive_input doesn't work perfectly: some negative values can also pass the test
6. One big challenge is : if we build new hotel rooms, should build another hotel room resources and overwrite the old one ? If so, should we actually stop the use of old rooms from previous customers? 
7. Added in clearing screen: 
	import os 
	and use "os.system("clear")"
