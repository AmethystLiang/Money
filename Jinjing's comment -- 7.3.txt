1.Played around and fixed some math numbers to make customer flow more reasonable in our time 
2.Moved the random number generator to outside the for loop for hotel.So that it's easier to change a hotel.Also, the customer only try once more if they can't find a room type they want in a hotel.This simplifies things.
3. Added a check_confirm() function in Tools.py to check Y or N input
4. Adding in more features in WeeklyReport part:
	a. a summary in Hotel.py to report the number of rooms
	b. prompt the user to enter option for upgrading (get_option() function in Tools.py)
	c. Still need to get each option working .
5. fixed the problem that a customer arrival actually didn't alter the number of checked rooms (I used your simpy_rooms instead of the room dictionary)

6.One big problem: the simpy_rooms are not getting the number of rooms correctly from input.Always smaller than the input. don't understand why. #Latest version : already fixed this.Just a typo
